/// FlowComposer(
///   placeholder: 'Message…',
///   isStreaming: generating,
///   onSend: (text) => startGeneration(text),
///   onStop: cancelGeneration,
///   // Renders the attach button and opens the platform's file dialog.

///   onRemoveAttachment: (id) => setState(() => pending.removeWhere(...)),
///   leadingActions: [FlowMenu(...)],

/// )
/// ```
///
/// On hardware keyboards Enter sends and Shift+Enter inserts a newline
/// (when [submitOnEnter]); mobile soft keyboards keep their newline key and
/// use the send button.
///
/// ## Attaching
///
/// The attach button appears when the composer is told who picks — and
/// which callback that is decides where the dialog comes from:
///
/// * [onAttachmentsPicked] — the package picks. It opens the platform's
///   own file dialog, reads and decodes what comes back, and hands over
///   ready-made [FlowAttachment]s. [attachmentOptions] says what is
///   accepted; [onAttachmentRejected] reports what wasn't.
/// * [onAttach] — the host picks. The button becomes a plain intent, for
///   a photo sheet, a camera, a menu of sources, or anything else the
///   package has no business knowing about.
///
/// Passing neither leaves the button off, which is the opt-out; passing
/// both asserts, since one button cannot have two owners. To open the
/// same dialog from somewhere other than the built-in button — the
/// design's "+" menu, say — call [showFlowAttachmentPicker] and pass the
/// result back through [attachments]. Either way the pending strip is
/// still the host's state, fed back through [attachments] and pruned
/// through [onRemoveAttachment] — the composer holds nothing.
///
/// The button's own icon color is [FlowComposerStyle.attachIconColor].
///
/// [onAttachmentsDropped] and [onAttachmentsPasted] are the other two
/// ways in, and both stack with either of the above. The first makes the
/// card a drop target, lighting it up while a file is over it — scope is
/// the only choice to make there, since
/// `FlowChatView.onAttachmentsDropped` catches a drop anywhere on the
/// surface and this one only over the card, and wiring both is fine
/// because the innermost target under the pointer wins. The second takes
/// an image pasted into the field.
///
/// Both are web-only — the SDK has no OS file drop and no image
/// clipboard anywhere else — so the attach button is what carries the
/// feature on every other platform, and most hosts point all of these at
/// the same handler. [attachmentsEnabled] turns every way in off at once
/// without unwiring any of them.
///
/// Once something is pending, an empty field is no longer nothing to
/// send: [onSend] fires with an empty string, because a picture with no
/// caption is a message.
